# Pictures-Downloader
Allows you to download up to 6000 pictures!

This program will let you download pictures to up to 6000 and how it works is that the program asks to what pictures do you want. Note that not every picture is guaranteed to be what you asked for since the program downloads them from a website. after that the program asks you how many pictures do you want from 0 to 6000 with a downside that it will download only only amounts of pictures that multiply by 60 for example if you ask for 120 pictures you'll get 120 but if for example you ask for 500 it will round the picture amount to 540. Then the program will ask the name of the txt file. The txt file is needed because if you download 6000 pictures obviously they will weigh a lot so to minimize the weight of the pictures the program gets the url of each picture and puts it into a txt file making it so 6000 pictures will weigh around 1 mb. If you need the pictures thems selves and downloading them manually from urls is difficult and tedious I will soon add a script that will allow you to download the pictures but yet again be aware that if you will try to use that script for 6000 pictures it will weigh a lot.
